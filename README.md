Projecte Multimèdia

I followed the layout of the last CV I prepared for my summer job search.
I chose this design-inspired by the Harvard CV style-because it’s backed 
by research showing it’s an effective format.

A black-and-white palette keeps the focus on the content; if color is used, 
it should be applied very sparingly. Recruiters typically scan a CV in under 
one minute, so the subconscious impact of the layout matters for that first 
impression. I also chose not to include a photo—not only for privacy reasons,
but also to avoid the risk that an unflattering or out-of-context image could
hurt my candidacy. Leaving it out keeps the focus on the information that 
I want them to focus.


The goal is to create a CV that avoids immediate rejection by surfacing 
the most important information clearly. For that reason, I divided the 
content into four sections:

	- Header: A concise introduction with my contact details. 
	If the CV passes the initial scan, it’s crucial that the interviewer 
	can quickly find this information; after the first filter, the rest is 
	rarely read in depth until the interview.

	- Work Experience: Although this can be less relevant for recent 
	graduates, in my case, as coming from "Formació Professional"
	and with relevant experience in that field, I decided to place 
	it before Education.

	- Education: A summary of my academic background.

	- Additional Information: Brief notes on languages I speak, 
	my ability to commute independently to the workplace, some programming 
	languages I enjoy, and selected tools I use.

For the implementation, I used lists extensively because they present short, 
scannable information effectively. 

The phone number, email address, and location shown are placeholders-
intentionally fictitious for my privacy.
